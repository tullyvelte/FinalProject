OVERVIEW
1.	Project Background and Description
Can you really judge a book by its cover? We intend to use machine learning to find out! We will use machine learning to create models for the best and worst amazon reviewed book covers and create a model that will allow a user to upload a book cover image and receive a predicted review score.
2.	Project Scope
We will need a script to query our amazon data and strip the url from the review metadata. Then, we will need to use Googleâ€™s Vision API to run analysis on the images. Once we have the data of various aspects of each image, we will train our models with what characteristics are indicative of a high and low score.  
3.	High-Level Requirements
Python, HTML, CSS, Java, Google Vision API, Amazon dataset 
4.	Data Sources
